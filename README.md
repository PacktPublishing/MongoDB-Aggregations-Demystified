# Practical MongoDB Aggregations

Code examples for the second half of the book _Practical MongoDB Aggregations_, published by Packt and authored by Paul Done.

## Book Description

Officially endorsed by MongoDB, Inc., _Practical MongoDB Aggregations_ helps you unlock the full potential of the MongoDB aggregation framework, including the latest features of MongoDB 7.0. The book provides practical, easy-to-digest principles and approaches for increasing your effectiveness in developing aggregation pipelines, supported by examples for building pipelines to solve complex data manipulation and analytical tasks.

The book is aimed at developers, architects, data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists with some familiarity with the aggregation framework. 

## Code Example Instructions

You can find the code for each of the book's examples in a sub-folder of this repository's `Examples` folder. 

You can run an example by copying and pasting the example's code into MongoDB Shell, running the file as a MongoDB Shell script, or running in VSCode using the MongoDB for VScode Playground.

The following command line shows you how to run the first example via the MongoDB Shell as a script: 

```
mongosh --quiet "mongodb+srv://myuser:mypasswd@mycluster.abc123.mongodb.net/" Examples/Chapter-06-Foundational-Examples/1-filtered-top-subset.mongodb.js
```

Before running this command, you must correct the username, password, and cluster domain name above to match your own environment.
